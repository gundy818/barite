# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security issues will be fixed in current releases, but generally wont be fixed in old releases, unless there's an issue that stops people upgrading. 
If there is such an issue, the focus will be of removing the issue so that people CAN upgrade, rather than on providing fixes to old versions.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any security problems with this code, please drop me a line privately and I will get straight back to you with a plan. 
Once I have a fix it'd be great if you are available to review the fix and ensure that it fixes the issue, but if you can't do this it's fine.
